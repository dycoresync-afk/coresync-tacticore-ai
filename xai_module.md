# Explainable AI (XAI) Module - TactiCore AI

## Overview
The XAI module is a core component of TactiCore AI, ensuring transparent, auditable, and compliant decision-making for mission planning in defense, law enforcement, and enterprise security. Built to address the "black box" pitfalls of legacy AI, it delivers actionable insights with clear reasoning, meeting strict regulatory standards like GDPR and DoD requirements.

## Purpose
- **Transparency**: Provides human-understandable explanations for AI-driven predictions (e.g., threat scores from HUMINT/SIGINT/OSINT fusion).
- **Compliance**: Aligns with GDPR's "right to explanation" and DoD's auditable AI mandates, reducing liability risks.
- **Trust**: Empowers operators with confidence in real-time decisions, critical for high-stakes ops.
- **Scalability**: Supports modular integration with planned Web3 audit logs for tamper-proof records.

## Current Status
- **Alpha Stage**: In active development with UNSCO/UNTSO security teams, focusing on initial fusion and explanation logic.
- **Key Features**:
  - Real-time explanation generation using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
  - Stub implementation in `src/tacticore/explainable_ai.py` for threat assessment clarity.
  - Integration with data fusion module (`data_fusion.py`) for end-to-end traceability.
- **Milestones**:
  - Q4 2025: Alpha feedback from UN pilots.
  - Q1 2026: Full XAI rollout with UN DSS pilot ($100K), including compliance certs.
  - Y2: Scalable XAI for 10 contracts ($3M ARR).

## Technical Details
- **Framework**: Built with PyTorch and SHAP for robust, interpretable models.
- **Approach**: Combines local and global explanation techniques to highlight key intel contributors (e.g., OSINT weighting).
- **Code Structure**: Modular design in `src/tacticore/`, with unit tests in `tests/test_fusion.py` ensuring reliability.
- **Future Integration**: Planned Solana-based zk-proofs for privacy-preserving explanations, enhancing sovereignty.

## Why It Matters to Investors
- **Market Edge**: Differentiates TactiCore from opaque competitors (e.g., Palantir) with 30% cost savings and 50% faster deployment.
- **Risk Mitigation**: Proactively addresses regulatory scrutiny, a key VC concern in defsec (e.g., ITAR compliance).
- **Traction Proof**: Alpha with UN teams signals demand; AUSA 2025 demos will validate market fit.
- **Growth Potential**: $20M ARR by Y5 (100 contracts) hinges on trusted AI—XAI is the backbone.

## How to Explore
- **Run Demo**: `python src/main.py` showcases a stubbed XAI output.
